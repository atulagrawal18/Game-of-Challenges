Apart from adding new features following are the list of enhancements on current effects.

1. Showing a sample frame to user after the input of parameters for each effect.
2. Input any type of audio file and output any type of video file. (currently wav for i/p and avi for o/p)
2. Automatically determine best possible font size for each string separately.
3. Configure different font family for each string (from user)
4. Take input of X and Y coordinates from user where the string appears in the frame.
5. Different types of configuration for different effects (e.g. radius for curve effects, speed for bounce effects)
6. Use gradient colors in the text instead of fix color.
